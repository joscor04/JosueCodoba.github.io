Like many who start a new project, I started this podcast with high hopes but vague aspirations. I knew I could talk passionately to guests about engineering. I also had a kernel of the theme: to focus on the "human side of engineering." My idea was basically to take the guest intro of every other engineering podcast and stetch it out to be the whole show.

Knowing I could do it and having an initial idea was enough to get me started. But within a few months it proved draining to produce a podcast on top of a full-time job and spending time with my family, and I found myself publishing less frequently. Being honest with myself, I also slowed down because I had started to realize how hard it would be to find and build an audience.

But then a funny thing happened. In the same week, a new CS grad I'd never met emailed to say an episode inspired her. And a family friend who doesn't work in tech told me they started listening. And a former colleague who does work in tech posted that they were inspired by the show. I realized that the point of the show was not how many but how much -- if you only reach a few people but make a genuine impact, well then you have made a genuine impact.

Which got me energized to work on the show again, and also got me thinking about kind of impact I want the project to have. Why does this show exist? What can you expect? What can you get here you can't get anywhere else?

I think the answer is guidance. Not direct, tutorial guidance, but vocational and valuable nonetheless. Think of each episode of **Using Reflection** as an informational interview. It's not a direct path to a goal, but rather a nuanced conversation that provides context and helps you connect a dot or two. Or think of it as a passionate, nerdy conversation about some technical subject or career learning experience. The kind of conversation many of us engaged engineers regularly have with our friends and colleagues.

Each episode is a chance for you to eavesdrop on that kind of conversation. While we may discuss particular subjects, this is not yet another podcast about a particular industry, company, technology or project. It is instead a podcast about the broader subject of engineering as an ongoing, enthusiastic journey of learning, and sharing what we learn.

I hope you feel that enthusiasm when you listen, and I hope you learn something along the way. Most of all I hope you too are inspired to share.
