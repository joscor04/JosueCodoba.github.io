If you are an engineer thinking about launching a blog and/or podcast, this project is a great place to start. It really shines if you want to have a single unified web site for both a podcast feed and a blog feed. `jekyll` is a great static site generator for blogs. `jekyll-octopod` is a great `jekyll` plugin that adds almost everything you need to extend `jekyll` for hosting a podcast. But neither supports one site that have a separate blog and podcast feed. This modification/example does.

This project is not intended to be a substitute for learning `jekyll` and `jekyll-octopod`. Both projects have excellent online documentation. To get started [install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), then go to the excellent [jekyll-octopod site](https://jekyll-octopod.github.io/) and follow the installation instructions. Then come back here, clone this repo into a directory, and start hacking.

So this project also assumes you are developer. You will figure out how to change images, links, HTML, SASS and jekyll's `Liquid` templating code.

That said, it's better to start here (or with some other example site) than from scratch because you have a full working example, less any of your content, and some features are already in place for you.

In particular, this project modifies the underlying jekyll files to support having two feeds on your site, one for podcast entries and one for blog entries. You will see the included `all_episodes.md` page is the listing page for podcast episodes, and the included `show_blog.md` page is the listing page for blog entries.

To create new podcast episodes, copy the provided `_posts/sample_episode.md` file, give it a name like `my_first_episode.md`, and modify the front matter appropriately. Copy your episode audio file into the `episodes` folder. The name of your audio file must match the value you provide for the key `audio` in the `my_first_episode.md` file YAML front matter.
